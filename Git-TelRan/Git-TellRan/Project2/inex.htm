    <h1>Christmas Trees in Europe</h1>
    <img src="./Images/R.jpg" alt="tree">
    <p>
        A Christmas tree is a decorated tree, usually an evergreen conifer, such as a spruce, pine or fir, or an
        artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of Christmas. The custom was further
        developed in early modern Germany where German Protestant Christians brought decorated trees into their homes.
        It acquired popularity beyond the Lutheran areas of Germany and the Baltic governorates during the second half
        of the 19th century, at first among the upper classes.

            of course the giant Christmas tree, located in the scenic old town centre, decorated with thousands of
            lights, ribbons and bells. The market attracts more than 3 million visitors per year with more than 200
            stalls to keep them busy. Many of the stalls sell classic wooden toys, rocking horses, dolls and
            decorations; others focus on delicious Christmas specialities like mulled wine, roast chestnuts, grilled
            sausages and gingerbread, filling the air with wonderful yuletide aromas. Don't miss out on the historical
            merry-go-round, lit up and decorated with wooden carved horses. It starts at the end of November and carries
            on through December.
